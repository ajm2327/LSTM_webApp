# models/lstm_model.py

In lstm_model.py it imports numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, finance for stock date, sklearn MinMaxScaler for data normalization, keras layers/models/optimizers for deep learnings, and keras callbacks EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint for training management. Joblib is imported for loading models, logging for logging, os for file operations, json for metadata handling, and datetime for timestamps. 

The stock predictor class first sets up default parameters like backcandles, target column and feature columns, lstm layer size, training batch size, epochs, split, and patience. 

Get_ticker_data gets the stock data of a specified ticker, it uses yginance to get the data. The add_indicators function computes and adds technical idnicators to the dataset. It computes RSI, EMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands, macD, atr, and OBV. 

The scale_data function uses the historical data to create and fit a scaler, and save it for training. The prepare_lstm_data function creates sequences for time series predictions. It uses data preparation for data cleaning and normalization. The method implements a sliding window approach where each prediction is based on a sequence of previous observations. The add_indicators method combined with these preparation steps ensures the LSTM has access to both raw price data and the calculated technical indicators. 


Finally, we have the create_and_train_lstm function which handles the core ML functionality. This is training, prediction, and model persistence. It is like teaching a student by showing examples and letting them practice making predictions until they improve. The neural network architecture is first defined, with lstm_input, and modifying the inputs to include the lstm layers, dense layers, activation layers, and then it creates the model. It uses adam to optimize the learning rate and compiles the model with the adam optimizer tuned. THe modelcheckpoint and earlystopping is to safeguard overfitting the model so that it isn’t trying too hard to predict with accuracy. There is a fine line between undertraining and overtraining that the model has been fine tuned for best performance with SPY. The model is finally trained and returned for prediction. There are two predictions that can be made, a high level training method and a prediction method. The train() function orchestrates the entire training process. It uses prepare_lstm_data to prepare the LSTM sequences. Before this it puts everything together by using the get_ticker_data, add_indicators, prepare_target, clean_data and scale_data functions to follow te pipeline in creating the model. After completing the data pipeline and sequences, it splits the dataset into training and testing set, the 80/20 split. 

The save_model method preserves the trained model and its necessary information by saving it with a timestamp and version path. It creates a unique directory with this information and dumps the information into a json file for retrieval. After this of course, we have our load model function which retrieves a model’s json file based on the information defined in the save_model function. 


# models/user.py

*NOTE*: 
user.py is kept in the models directory because this follows the domain model pattern which is widely accepted practice in web app development. The models directory contains all core business objects that represent the app’s domain entities. SO basically our stakeholders being the lstm and the users. Both user and LSTM models represent core domain entities int he application. They are both models essentially because they encapsulate business logic and data structures. They also both use SQLALchemy and interact with the database layer in similar ways. This part is essential for PHASE 2. Each model has distinct responsibilities of course, the User handles authentication and user management, while the LSTM model handles the predictions and analysis of course. 

The user model serves as the core user authentication and management system for the LSTM tool. It is implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM and Flask Login to provide secure user auth and session management. 

The user model implements several key interfaces and features, it uses UUID-based primary keys for security, secure password hashing, timezone-aware timestamps, and subscription tier support (which might be implemented later on. I’m leaning toward not creating a subscription for this because it isn’t an astonishing tool, I’m just learning how develop an app), it has activity tracking, and Flask-login integration. 

The authentication flow follows user registration ‘db.session.add(user)’ and then user login ‘login_user(user). The user model has user specific prediction history, API usage tacking, model access permissions and subscription based feature access. 

The passwords are never stored in plain text, scrypt hashing is used by default. Salt is automatically handled by Werkzeug. The flask-login handles secure session management and configures session timeouts. The user model has active status tracking, and login tracking. 

In the future, the user model should get enhanced user preferences storage, prediction history tacking, and custom model configuration storage as well as API key management. 

For maintenance, the user database table should be monitored for growth, review authentication logs, check for inactive users, and update password hashing for security. 


# utils/logger_config.py

The logger configuration establishes comprehensive logging system to track, debug, and monitor the application’s behavior across different components. It captures different app events at different severity levels and outputs them to either app logs or error logs in different formats. This is important to track errors and actions for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining the app. 

First we make sure the logger directory is set up, it creates a logs directory if it doesn’t exist yet. After this the file formatter using logging.Formatter creates detailed log entries with timestamps, log names and severity levels. The console formatter also uses logging.Formatter to produce a simpler format for readability. These should be improved later. 

After defining the formats for logging, the file handler uses rotating file handlers for both general logs, our app.log and errors in error.log. These handlers rotate log files when they reach 10MB and keeps up to 5 backup files. This is to manage the amount of space that logging could take up with the amount of events that get logged. 

After the file handler, the console handler is defined to output logs to the console during development so that the logging is displayed real time. This is easier to review real time in development instead of retrieving the log files every time. 

Loggers is defined for component specific logging with the api, the model, and the metrics in the application. Separate loggers is best for filtering and handling component specific features. 

Throughout the codebase will be logging defined like

Logger = logging.getLogger(‘api’)
logger.info(“API endpoint called”)
logging.error(“Database connection failed”)

The logging configuration is important for debugging and production monitoring. 

# utils/metrics.py

The metrics implementation is simple and could be improved further in the future. The metrics manager class currently calculates and logs different performance metrics for the LSTM stock prediction model. It uses scikit learn metrics and the custom logging configuration and error handling to provide reliable model evaluation capabilities. 

The calculate_basic_metrics(y_true, y_pred) function calculates the model performance metrics using the actual and predicted values. The parameters are self explanatory as to which is the actual and which is the predicted values. It will return a function for MSE, RMSE, MAE, and r2. 

Logs are categorized under the metrics logger name for easy filtering and monitoring. 
Always check the returned metrics dictionary contains valid values. The metricsManager is primarily used for model evaluation under training, performance monitoring during predictions, the app.py documentation went over the metrics API endpoint that relies on this class. 

The metrics functionality could be improved by adding additional metrics to calculate, historical tracking of metrics, and add visualization for analyzing trends in performance. It should get confidence intervals for metrics, and add support for custom metrics. 


# config/redis.py
The redis.py contains a RedisConfig class that handles the redis configuration. It uses a singleton-like pattern through the Flask app context and follows the flask extension pattern with init_app. It uses the environment variable configuration to set the redis URL and tests the connection with a basic ping. The redis.py file will be improved and updated for better connection pooling, timeout handling and connection monitoring. Additionally the other files that pertain to Redis should be updated to use a to have a centralized connection through redis.py instead of creating multiple connections. There are multiple places in the code where new redis connections are made. This bypasses the connection pooling setup and ignores the configured error handling and monitoring. 

The new redis.py file initializes the redis connection by getting the configuration variables from the environment. Then it configures the connection pool through ConnectionPool.from_url() using the redis url and defined configuration variables. After the redis client is created with the pool, the connection is tested by pinging the client. The configuration and redis client are added to the app context. 

The utility functions defined in the redis configuration is 
- _test_connection(self) for testing the redis connection with a ping
- get_client(self) for getting the redis client instance
- get_health_status(self) for getting the redis connection health status

Finally the module uses init_redis(app) to initalize the redis configuration.
